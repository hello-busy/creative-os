## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- MongoDB 6 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update `.env` with your local settings

4. Start MongoDB

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Project Structure

â””â”€â”€ tests/              # Test files (to be added)
```

## Code Style

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Naming Conventions
- Files: camelCase (e.g., `userController.js`)
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `User`)
- Variables/Functions: camelCase (e.g., `getUserData`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)

## Making Changes

### Adding New Features

1. **Models**: Create or update models in `src/models/`
2. **Controllers**: Add business logic in `src/controllers/`
3. **Routes**: Define endpoints in `src/routes/`
4. **Middleware**: Add reusable logic in `src/middleware/`
5. **Frontend**: Update UI in `public/`

### Database Changes

If you modify schemas:
1. Update the model file
2. Consider migration impact
3. Document breaking changes
4. Update API documentation

### API Changes

When modifying APIs:
1. Maintain backward compatibility when possible
2. Update `API.md` documentation
3. Update frontend if needed
4. Test all affected endpoints

## Testing

Currently, the project uses manual testing. Future contributions should include:

### Test Structure (To Be Implemented)
```bash
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests
â””â”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Gamification System

When adding new features that award points or badges:

1. Update `src/middleware/gamification.js`
2. Document point values in `API.md`
3. Update badge list if adding new badges
4. Consider level progression impact

### Point Guidelines
- Small actions (likes, comments): 2-5 points
- Medium actions (posts, joins): 5-20 points
- Large actions (creations): 20-100 points

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- `feat: Add leaderboard sorting`
- `fix: Resolve authentication bug`
- `docs: Update API documentation`
- `style: Format code`
- `refactor: Improve gamification logic`
- `test: Add user registration tests`
- `chore: Update dependencies`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README, API.md, and USAGE_GUIDE.md are updated
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your changes in different scenarios
3. **Clean Code**: Remove console.logs and debug code
4. **Small PRs**: Keep pull requests focused and manageable
5. **Description**: Clearly describe what changes you made and why
