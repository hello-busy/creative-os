# Aurora â€” Final Specification (Scaffolded)

This file is the canonical high-level spec for Project Aurora. It is intentionally concise here; the full specification lives in the issue tracker and will be expanded into subsystem RFCs.

- Hybrid kernel (L4 microkernel + monolithic modules)
- Memory, process, driver, and networking design notes
- UI: SwiftUI-based frontends + C++ back-end libraries
- Universal App Framework: C++ core libraries + Swift wrappers
- Aurora Assist: privacy-first AI assistant (on-device-first architecture)
- Cloud integrations with E2E encryption and provider adapters

Refer to ROADMAP.md for phased implementation and issues (Phase 1..5).
